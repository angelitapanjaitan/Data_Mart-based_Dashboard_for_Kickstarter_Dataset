This project is my final project from the Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence Course. This project was created with my class team which consists of 6 students.


# Data_Mart-based_Dashboard_for_Kickstarter_Dataset
This repository contains documents on data processing, building ETL, and data visualization using Pentaho and Tableau. The data source is from the Kickstarter Data Set. Our team used a Kickstarter dataset from 2022 and created several analysis questions using it.
